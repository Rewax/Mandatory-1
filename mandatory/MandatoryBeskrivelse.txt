Mandatory I

Create a website that contains documentation for what you have learned.

Assignment type: Individual
Feedback: Random checks

Deadline: October 17th 23:59 (May change)
Hand-in type: Git link on Fronter

Requirements:
Serve the pages with Express
Split up the documentation in pages rather than one long HTML page
The exception to the above rule is if you choose a Web Framework / Library for SPA. You are for instance allowed to use React for this assignment to try and learn something new but this might not be allowed for the Exam Project and Mandatory II.
Should have some nice styling (custom or with a styling framework)
Requirements about the documentation:
Should contain terminal commands
Should contain code snippets
Should contain all the tools we’ve used and explain them
Should cover theory that we’ve touched upon

Consider:
Use DOM methods to make it a nicer user experience

Bonus:
Research a covered topic in-depth you want to understand better
Learn something new



If you do not manage to hand-in the mandatory in time you might need to complete another assignment.
